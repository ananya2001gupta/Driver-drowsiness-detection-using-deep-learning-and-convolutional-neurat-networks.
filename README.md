# Driver-drowsiness-detection-using-deep-learning-and-convolutional-neurat-networks.
In this project we will train our model on open and close eyes dataset then use that with face recognition library to check if the driver is sleeping or not.

step 1 - Dataset download through this link:
http://mrl.cs.vsb.cz/index.html

step 2 - data preparation:
separating open and close eyes pictures in train and test data.

step 3 - preprocessing and generation of data ( batch size and EPOCHS(1-10).

step 4 - model training and implementation through given dataset.
Neural Network uses 12 layers ( 4 convolutional, 4 pool, 1 flatten, 1 dropout, 3 dense layers, model's stride = 1, filter size 3X3).

step 5 - Compile the model.

step 6 - Predicting and validating.
